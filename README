Briar Patch
-----------

Metrics, alerts and events framework

Using ZeroMQ on the inside, Briar Patch will be a way to allow multiple
incoming data streams all be handled/filtered/massaged and then consumed
by various workers as needed.

Yea, I don't know what it will be quite yet either...

Installation
------------

Briar-Patch is two distinct parts: the buildduty/kitten managment piece and
the metrics piece. Pick what piece you are working with and follow those
instructions below.

My primary dev environment is OS X, so I use Brew almost exclusively, so all
of the install notes below reference Brew.

Brew can be found at http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Except for Python, which I kept at v2.7, everything else is as fresh as you
can stand.

For the buildduty part, you need to install:

  pip install ssh
  pip install boto
  pip install requests
  pip install dnspython

  git clone git://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git
  cd redis-py
  python setup.py install
  cd ..

For the metrics part, you need:

  Note: pyzmq will need the python development libraries loaded, gcc build environment
        and zeromq source tarball.  This needs to be build and installed before installing
        pyzmq

  pip install requests
  pip install dnspython
  pip install pyzmq

  git clone git://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git
  cd redis-py
  python setup.py install
  cd ..

  hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/clegnitto_mozilla.com/mozillapulse
  cd mozillapulse
  python setup.py install
  cd ..
